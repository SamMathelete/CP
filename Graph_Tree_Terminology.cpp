Terminology:

1. Vertex
2. Edge
3. Unidirectional Edge
4. Bidirectional Edge

Tree: Graphs with no cycles
For Trees:
    No. of Nodes = n
    No. of Edges = n-1
    
5. Connected Components:
    If a component of a graph is connected then it is always possible to travel from
    one vertex to another in that component of the graph.

6. In a directed graph, it is possible to traverse an edge only in the direction it is directed to.
    - Cycle definition varies from undirected to directed graphs.
    - Directed Acyclic graphs
    - Directed Cyclic graphs
    - Strongly connected components in directed graphs
    - Components in a directed graph(which are supposed to be connected)

7. Collection of connected components is called forest.

8. Root node of a tree: A node which has no parent node in the same tree
9. Depth of node = Distance of node from root node
10 Leaf Node: Nodes with no child Nodes
11. Height of tree: Depth of the deepest leaf node of the tree
12. Lowest Common Ancestor: The first common parent node to two nodes while traversing from both the nodes is called LCA of both the nodes.
